# Evaluations \& project topics

This is a 6 credits course (If you want to take it for 9 credits please let me know and we can try to arrange something).

## Evaluations

This course will have the following moments of evaluation:

| Type          | Percentage of grade      | Info                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Homework      | 30% (total) / 10% (each) | 3 sets of homework. <br>First set will be on the third week and then every two weeks for three times.                                  |
| Final project | 70%                      | Final project, either selected from the given list or proposed by you.<br>(If the latter, please discuss your idea with me in advance) |

The homework will be about the programming / technical side of the course.

## Project topics

Here are some possible final projects in order of increasing complexity:
- Review of the literature on the probabilistic Language of Thought.
- Review of the philosophical literature on the Language of Thought.
- Implement a model for learning spatial connectives in LOTlib3 (e.g., 'up', 'below', etc.)
- Comment the source code of LOTlib3.
- Choose a Bayesian approximation algorithm (e.g. reversible-jump Monte Carlo), implement it, and fit one of the models discussed in the second half of the course.
- Implement a model of geometric shape learning in LOTlib3 (quite a challenge! Not sure how well it can be done, but I judge the quality of the attempt even if it does not work well).
- Choose your own semantic domain and implement a model that learns it in LOTlib3 (Discuss your choice of domain with me first!).
