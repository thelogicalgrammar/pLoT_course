# Lab for 9th week

Since we did not finish it last week, this week we will go through the second
half of Piantadosi's tutorial,
which you can find [here](https://github.com/piantado/LOTlib3/blob/master/Documentation/Tutorial.md).

The tutorial is in a markdown file. 
To run the code, create a new notebook and run the following line:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/piantado/LOTlib3
import LOTlib3
from LOTlib3.Grammar import Grammar
```

This will download the library in the colab directory and import LOTlib3.
