# How to get things running on colab

While static files are fine when it comes to just reading the labs, programming and technical knowledge can't be learned passively.
You need to try things out.
Therefore, during the labs we are going to use google colab to host the notebooks and run them interactively. 
Here's a little guide on how to get the notebooks running in colab.

1. Open google colab by going to url 'https://colab.research.google.com/'
1. You should see something like this:

1. Click on 'github' in the yellow bar and type 'thelogicalgrammar/pLoT_course' on the searchbar.
1. A list of notebooks should appear, like this:

1. Click on the notebook you want to work with.
1. It should open a new google colab session.
1. Have fun!

Please don't hesitate to ask questions if anything is not clear or if something is not working.
