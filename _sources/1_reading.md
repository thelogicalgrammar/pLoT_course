# Reading

The reading for this week is [the SEP entry on the Language of Thought](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/). In case you don't know it already, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is an incredible collection of publication-level articles on very many philosophical topics, written by experts in the fields.

If you haven't done philosophy before, this reading might be a bit difficult to understand. Please try to figure out exactly where things get confusing and write down a question. Either send it to me through the 'Ask a question!' section of this website, or bring it with you to the lecture on Monday.

_Optionally_, also read [the SEP entry on Computational Theories of Mind](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computational-mind/).
